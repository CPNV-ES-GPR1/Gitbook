# Scrum - le sprint

* [Récupérer le scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/index.html)

### Introduction <a href="#scrum-definition" id="scrum-definition"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully <mark style="color:orange;">incomplete</mark>, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. <mark style="color:orange;">Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it</mark>. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed <mark style="color:orange;">within the framework</mark>. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. <mark style="color:orange;">Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management</mark>, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.
{% endhint %}

## Les piliers de Scrum

### Transparency <a href="#transparency" id="transparency"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

<mark style="color:orange;">Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Inspection <a href="#inspection" id="inspection"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

<mark style="color:orange;">Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change</mark>.
{% endhint %}

### Adaptation <a href="#adaptation" id="adaptation"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. <mark style="color:orange;">The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.</mark>

Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.
